# PHRETS

A simple, free, open source PHP library for using [RETS](http://rets.org).

PHP + RETS = PHRETS


## Introduction

PHRETS provides PHP developers a way to integrate RETS functionality directly within new or existing code. A standard class of functions is made available to developers to connect and interact with a server much like they would with other APIs.

PHRETS handles the following aspects of RETS communication for you:
* Response parsing (for other non-XML responses such as HTTP multipart)
* XML Parsing
* Simple variables and arrays returned to the developer
* RETS communication (over HTTP)
* HTTP Header management
* Authentication
* Session/Cookie management
